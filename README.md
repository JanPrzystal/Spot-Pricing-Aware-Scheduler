**Spot Pricing-Aware Scheduler**
This project is based on the OpenDC platform for datacenter simulation (https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc.git)

This repository implements a spot pricing-aware scheduler which is meant to minimize the financial cost of computing a workload on cloud instances. The scheduler leverages the pricing data and the hosts' capabilities to reduce the total price needed to complete the workload.
